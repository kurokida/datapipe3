# DataPipe demo

[DataPipe](https://pipe.jspsych.org/) is an excellent tool developed by the [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/) team to send data from an experimental program to the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/). Here is a demo using the DataPipe.

This is a sample program running on GitHub pages. When "Hello world!" appears, press any key. (remember that key).

Your response will be stored in the OSF project.

I plan to disable the OSF token at a later date. If I do so, no new data will be saved. Past data can be referenced.
